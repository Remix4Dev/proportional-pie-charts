# how to use with Inkscape
1. Use the spreadsheet to calculate the diameter (and thus area) for each segment and the arc lengths.
2. For each wedge, select the layer, make it a full circle, then transform using the calculated diameter to have the right proportion.
3. Change the arc diameter to what is listed on the spreadsheet.
4. Continue for each wedge until done.
